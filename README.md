The roughly idea of this program is to work with a projection of a fucntion on a cartesian coordinates system.

I have written it as a part of my university study of electric engineering.




Steps:  
1. getting number of points of the function with some other functional paramaters 
2. calculating the missing parameters and dynamic allocation of the space to save the function points  
3. creating a mathematical function line in cartesian coordinates system out of the points provided by the user + calculated parameters
4. printing out all y- and x-values of the function in pairs
5. calculating the x-value to any y-value provided by the user
6. deleting the alocated space and ending



DETAILS: 

Every input is secured against any kind of mistype or wrong data, and the program will act accordingly to either stop and ask the user for retry,
or move on with the values which are predefined for this type of mistype.
It is also secured against common C-Failures like overflow or underflow.
